Bluechirp is a free and open-source client for the Mastodon social network.

Powered by UWP and WinUI 2, it guarantees that the user experience will be identical to the one in official "fluent" style apps.

## :clock1: Background Story
This project once started as a custom Twitter client instead, but as you may have imagined, after what happened in October 27th 2022, it has become a Mastodon client.  
This original idea was further blocked by the fact that by January 2023, all custom clients were banned without previous warning.

I tried to make my own client from scratch, but I didn't know how to structure the codebase cleanly, so I abandoned it.  
I then found Tooter, an unfinished, also abandoned UWP client for Mastodon that was looking for a new owner.

After a very short conversation on [issue #1](https://github.com/AnalogFeelings/Bluechirp/issues/1), I became the owner of Tooter, which I've since rebranded to Bluechirp.  
I rebranded it because the name Tooter has already been picked up by other Mastodon clients and social medias.
